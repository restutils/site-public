# First Release of RESTUtils Host

More than likely you're here for the [RESTUtils Host](https://www.npmjs.com/package/restutils-host); a small utility that instantly converts any JavaScript library or Node package into a web-based REST API with one command:

```bash
npx restutils-host --path ~/my-utility.js
```

Of course, you can tell it to grab your package from a Git repo:

```bash
npx restutils-host --repo https://github.com/codergod/my-utility.git
```

... or even NPM itself, if your library is already published...

```bash
npx restutils-host --name my-utility
```

Here's a quick video showing how to use it:

Until then, have a great day!
