The RESTUtils Host makes it so easy to generate APIs with one command that it’s only fitting to generate the appropriate API clients also with one command. No installation is neccessary. From within your application simply tell the RESTUtils Client where your APIs are hosted: npx restutils-client --host http://localhost:3001 \\ --host http://localhost:3002 \\ --host http://localhost:3003 Of course, it’s probably better to give your generated API clients names: npx restutils-client --host http://localhost:3001 --name mailboxes \\ --host http://localhost:3002 --name processing \\ --host http://localhost:3003 --name storage-mobile … so you can reference them easier: const apis = require('./apis/client'); const main = async () =\u003e { const testData = { ... }; const result = await apis.storageMobile.messages.storeIncoming(testData); console.log('result:', result); } main(); Should you run into any snags, or have questions, feel free to reach out: info@restutils.com Until then, have a great day!
